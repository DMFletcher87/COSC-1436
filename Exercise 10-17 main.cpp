//Purpose: Write a program that allows two players to play the tic-tac-toe game. Your program must contain the class ticTacToe to implement a ticTacToe object. Include a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array, as a private member variable, to create the board. If needed, include additional member variables. Some of the operations on a ticTacToe object are printing the current board, getting a move, checking if a move is valid, and determining the winner after each move. Add additional operations as needed.

#include <iostream>
#include "TicTacToe.h"

using namespace std;

int main() {
  // Write your main here
  ticTacToe game;
  game.player();
    
    return 0;
}
